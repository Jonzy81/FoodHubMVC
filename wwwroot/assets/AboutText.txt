The HUB is a place that reaches beyond the boundaries of culinary tradition, while honoring food, flavour, sustainability and community. We welcome our guests to enjoy the seasonal swedish produce and our favourite vine in a warm and social atmosphere. 
<br> We always keep some seats for walk-ins. Please note that it's not possible to make a reservation by phone. For inquiries regarding catering and events, please contact us at catering@Foodhub.se
